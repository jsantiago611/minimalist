> **READ: Matthew 5:3.** Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

This is painful to say, but…being poor in spirit is not a character trait that is popular with modern people.

**_Our culture tells us _**we must be self-confident. We must be sure of ourselves. We must be strong and depend on no one, even our spouses. The personal development market is full of books and blogs about this!

**_Even the modern church_** doesn’t always value being “poor in spirit”. We value motivational speakers and dynamic personalities, but not the “poor in spirit.”

**_But Jesus taught_** that this was essential to being a growing Christian because he listed it first in his description of what it means to be a Christian.

_But what does it mean?_

### What it means to be Poor in Spirit

Martin Lloyd Jones, a doctor-turned-preacher, once wrote an incredibly piercing analysis on the sermon on the mount, titled “Studies in the Sermon on the Mount.” In it, he share a helpful definition of what it means to be poor in Spirit:

> To be poor in spirit means… a complete absence of pride, self-assurance, self-reliance. A consciousness that we are nothing in the presence of God… a tremendous awareness of our utter nothingness as we come face-to-face with God.”

### Prayer

Almighty God, how often I boast about the things that I have no control over: my natural abilities, personality type, moral behavior, nationality, upbringing.

Empty me of self-confidence, pride, self-reliance, and the appearance of humility. Rather, fill me with the knowledge that I am nothing before you. Let me say as Jesus says “ I can do nothing of myself.”

“Nothing in my hand I bring, simply to the cross I cling.” Amen.
